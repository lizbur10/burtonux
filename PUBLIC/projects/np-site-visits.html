				<h4>Approach</h4>
				<p>The main challenge with this project was to obtain authentic, in-context information from the participating organizations. Because the cadence of most Constant Contact customers' work with the product is intermittent, pure observational techniques were not feasible. Therefore, a hybrid approach was used that included both an interview and an observational component. The interview enabled us to obtain consistent information across all participating organizations. For the observational portion, participants were asked to have a real email campaign that they were actively working on so the research team could see their usual process.</p>

				<h4>Result</h4>
				<p>The following information was developed from the research:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Identification of sub-categories of NP organizations based on usage factors, priorities, limitations, etc.</li> 
					<li>Identification of usage factors that are particularly salient for this segment of users</li>
					<li>Ratings of the importance of each of the usage factors for each sub-category.</li>
				</ol>
