				<h2>The Design-Build Concept</h2>
	 			<p>In the construction industry there is an approach known as Design-Build, in which the same contractor is responsible for both the design and construction of the project: </p>
				<blockquote>"One entity, one contract, one unified flow of work from initial concept through completion &mdash; thereby re-integrating the roles of designer and constructor." (<a class="text-link" href="http://www.dbia.org/about/Pages/What-is-Design-Build.aspx" target="_blank">Design-Build Institute of America</a>)</blockquote>
				<p>What I offer is analogous &mdash; knowledge and training in user experience design and research along with front-end development skills. This enables me to:</p>
				<ul class="triangle-list">
					<li> take into consideration both UX and development implications in making design recommendations,</li>
					<li> know when and how to conduct and apply user research, and</li>
					<li> develop solutions that follow UX principles, meet business and user needs, and reflect state of the art, solid coding practices.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>On this site, you can see <a class="text-link" href="ux-projects.php">examples of my research and design work</a> and <a class="text-link" href="dev-projects.php">some of my development projects</a>. You can also <a class="text-link" href="resume.php">view my resume</a>.</p>
