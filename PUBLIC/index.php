            <p>I am an aspiring Web developer/software engineer and a recent graduate of the Flatiron School Online Full Stack Web Development program. My skillset includes React/Redux, Javascript, Ruby/Ruby on Rails, HTML/CSS, and Wordpress custom theming. I get great satisfaction from being able to design and develop websites and apps that are usable and fill a need.</p>
            <p>In 2011, after years of creeping professional doldrums, I made a career change. I completed the Human Factors in Information Design Master's degree program at Bentley University, and then worked as a UX Researcher for a couple of years. During that time, it became clear to me that while I firmly believed in the importance of UX research, my heart was really in the design and development side. I took some of the development classes at the Minneapolis College of Art and Design but it wasn't until I discovered the Flatiron program that I truly felt I'd found my way forward.</p>
            <p>I'm excited about the possibility of finding a job that will allow me to solidify and expand on my skills and, ideally, to make contributions that can have an impact on people's lives.</p>
