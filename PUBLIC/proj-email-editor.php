 				<h3>The Project</h3>
				<p>Ongoing research and design work to replace the company's legacy email editor with a state-of-the-art product.</p>
			</div>

			<div>
 				<h3>The Problem</h3>
				<p>As a long-time provider of e-mail marketing tools, the company faced an ongoing struggle to remain competitive in the market while still ensuring success for existing users. The legacy email editor needed a complete overhaul to continue to attract new customers, while current customers needed to be shielded from disruptions that could keep them from meeting their business needs.</p>
